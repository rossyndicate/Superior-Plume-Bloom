## superior-plume-bloom/eePlumB/A_PrepAOI/

The scripts in this subdirectory create tiles for labeling from a shapefile. In 
the case of this project, we take the NHDPlusHR waterbody shapefile for Lake 
Superior and create tiled AOI shapes for use in GEE. These files are manually 
uploaded as assets to GEE using the GEE IDE. The output is stored in the 
superior-plume-bloom/data/aoi/tiledAOI directory.
